# InchesToApp
InchesToApp is an application designed for performing metric conversion tasks. It allows users to convert measurements entered in inches to feet, meters, and miles. I developed this project to enhance my skills in Objective-C programming.

### Objectives
- Strengthen proficiency in Objective-C programming language
- Gain practical experience in developing iOS applications using Objective-C
- Implement design patterns and architectural principles in Objective-C projects
- Improve code readability, maintainability, and efficiency in Objective-C codebases
